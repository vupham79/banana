# Custom build demo

This very basic demo shows how to use webpack to do a custom build from our sources. 

*NOTE:* Unfortunately this demo does not work with the trial version, since it does not include sources. To be able to
make a custom build, you need the full version of Bryntum Gantt.

## Building

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to build it

After build, surf to `examples/custom-build/index.html` to see it in action.
